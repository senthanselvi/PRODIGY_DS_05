**Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization**

**Overview**

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. By exploring these factors, we aim to uncover accident hotspots and contributing factors. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle: US Accident EDA.

**Steps Completed**

Data Collection: Downloaded the traffic accident dataset from Kaggle.<br>
Data Cleaning: Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant information.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and relationships between various factors.
Pattern Identification: Analyzed how road conditions, weather, and time of day affect accident occurrences.
Visualization: Created visualizations to identify accident hotspots and highlight key contributing factors using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Insights: Summarized key findings and patterns from the analysis.

**Results**

The analysis revealed significant patterns and hotspots:
Accident Hotspots: Visualized geographic areas with high accident frequencies.
Contributing Factors: Identified key factors such as adverse weather conditions and specific times of day that increase accident likelihood.
Road Conditions: Highlighted the impact of various road conditions on accident occurrences.
